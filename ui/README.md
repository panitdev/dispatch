Welcome to the Dispatch frontend.

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
bun install
bun --bun run dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
bun --bun run test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `bun install @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss -D`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting. Eslint is configured using [tanstack/eslint-config](https://tanstack.com/config/latest/docs/eslint). The following scripts are available:

```bash
bun --bun run lint
bun --bun run format
bun --bun run check
```

## Deploy to Cloudflare Workers Static Assets

This project deploys the Vite `dist/` directory through Wrangler static assets with SPA fallback:

1. Install Wrangler: `npm install -g wrangler`
2. Authenticate: `wrangler login`
3. Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

Public browser config is read from `window.__ENV__` when Docker generates `env.js`, or from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL` at build time. Production static builds default to `https://dispatch-api.panit.dev` and `https://kratos.panit.dev`.

Static asset deployment is configured in `wrangler.jsonc` — see https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/.

## GitHub Actions CD

Production deploys run from [`.github/workflows/deploy-ui.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-ui.yml) on pushes to `main` that touch `ui/**`, or via manual `workflow_dispatch`.

Configure these repository secrets before enabling the workflow:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: API token with permission to deploy Workers for this account.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Cloudflare account ID for the target Workers account.

The workflow runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and then `bun run deploy` from `ui/`, which builds the app and publishes the static assets defined in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

The app shell is static HTML in `index.html`, and React mounts from `src/main.tsx`.
The shared route layout lives in `src/routes/__root.tsx`; route content appears
where the root route renders `<Outlet />`.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
